# Josh Price MLOps Demo Project

## Overview
I have created this project to demonstrate some general MLOps skills for potential employers.  

What I'll be describing here can be summarized as a Tensorflow model running from a Databricks notebook on an Azure cluster.  I'm using Databricks-hosted MLFlow to track and serve my model, which is a simple MNIST classification.
